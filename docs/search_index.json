[["methods.html", " 2 METHODS", " 2 METHODS Pearson correlation factors were calculated to determine correlation to crash severity in this study. Equation (2.1) shows how to calculate Pearson correlation given two potentially correlated variables, X and Y, using covariance. \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho = \\frac{\\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Manner of collision variables and pedestrian related variables were compared to crash severity to determine correlation factors. The pedestrian related variables used here are involvment of pedestrians, pedacycle, and motorcycle in the crash as well as the presence and number of schools and transit stops within 1000 feet of the crash. The resulting correlation factors for manner of collision are shown in Table 2.1 and the correlation factors for pedestrian variables are shown in Table 2.2. These correlation factors were evaluated at intersections and roadway segments separately to ensure homogeneity of roadway characteristics at crash locations.
