# QUESTIONS {#intro}


Research in network screening for highway safety analysis is continually developing and improving as data processing technologies and understanding of crash data improve. However, a major difficulty with most current network screening methodologies is that they do not account for the influence of crash severity towards the overall potential for safety improvement (PSI) of roadways. Therefore, it is valuable to use a crash severity-weighted approach when performing network screening. @yasmin2018 and @afghari2020 assert that a joint crash count with crash severity model is best suited to identify sites with the most PSI because of the correlation between crash counts and crash severity. As part of this joint model, it may be helpful to consider other factors which may contribute to the crash severity distribution at a given site. 

<!-- maybe talk about how this relates to above. Give context on who they are and what they did. -->
<!-- @ghadi2020 attempted to determine the impact of spatial and environmental factors on crash severity, but few others have added to this research. -->

<!-- Put these ideas first then tie into PSI -->
The purpose of this article is to identify any additional factors that may correlate to crash severity such as the manner of collision, the presence of pedestrians, the light conditions, and so on. The results of this article will help determine which of these factors are significant enough to include in severity-weighted network screening. In the past, many network screening models have been limited by precedent, but this research aims to expound on and improve these tried and tested methods. With better understanding of how crash factors relate to crash severity, it may be possible to more proactively prevent severe crashes rather than waiting for them to happen before they can be modeled.
