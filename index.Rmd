# QUESTIONS {#intro}


This repository serves as a template both in how to write a report, and how
to do so in RStudio and Bookdown. The parent repository is available as a free

  - Laurie Garrow
  - Lisa Rosenstein
  - Kara Kockelman
  
The introduction of your report is not simply an "introduction", but rather a

A three or four-paragraph structure can work well here.

  1. Identify the problem and why it matters.
  2. A high-level overview of some previous attempts to solve it, and why those 
  attempts were limited (this might be two paragraphs).
  2. Describe the approach (very briefly), and provide an overview of what is 
  to come. "In this paper we present ..."
